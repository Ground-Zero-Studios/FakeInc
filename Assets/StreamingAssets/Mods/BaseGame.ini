; =========================================================================================================================
;       BASE GAME CONFIGURATION FILE. DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. KEEP A BACKUP TOO!
; =========================================================================================================================
;	You may use this file as a base for your "mod". All mods will follow (more or less) this structure.
;	Some elements here interact with built in parameters which your mod most likely cannot interact. Keep that in mind.
;
;	While creating your modification, keep in mind this game was NOT originally designed with modding support in tought.
;	In fact, the game itself was only a big programming exercise for experience. The mod folder is actually a folder for
;	testing how dynamic a game system can be made. So the mod folder serves as a dynamic asset folder and also makes the
;	assets easier to be created, modified or removed. This system follows the same principles as the system present in
;	Westwood's Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun.
;
;	The game allows for users to load their own assets, but does not allow new functionality to be added to the game.
;
;	The game searches for files in their respective mod folders. "BaseGame" mod will search for it's files inside a folder
;	with the same name. A sound defined to notify.wav will be searched in that folder, so it's path is BaseGame/notify.wav
;	
;	Resources can be created, however, keep in mind they wont have any special functionality that's already not present in
;	the game. Most of the resources defined in this file are also relating to built in functionalities that you cannot
;	modify and possibly not even interact with in your new and custom assets.
;
;	You should not use the "\" character for file paths. If you really want to, you'll have to use \\ in it's place.
;	This is due to C# Regex and the way the modding system is built.
;
;	Prefixes Used:
;	EV = Event
;	EF = Effect
;	CD = Condition
;	RE = Resource
;	We used them, but you're not required to.
